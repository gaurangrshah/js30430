      // age = 200;
      // console.log("age value after update", age, age2);

      let name = "Wes";
      let name2 = name;

      // ============= ============= ============= =============

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      // console.log("initial arrays", players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "Lux";
      // console.log("updated arrays", players, team);
      // so both get updated when the original gets updated.
      // however what happens when we update that array?
      // now here is the problem!
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice(); // slice makes an actual copy when it has not args.
      // this means the original [players] is still untouched:
      // console.log("team2, players", team2, players);

      // or we can create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players); // more explict way
      // console.log("team3, players", team3, players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[2] = "";
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      // console.log("team4, players", team4, players);
      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[3] = "Boo Yah";
      console.log("team5, players", team5, players);
      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };
      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      // this will add the number to both captain an person
      captain.number = 99;
      // console.log("captain, person", captain, person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
        name: "Steven",
        number: 97,
        age: 12
      });
      // console.log("cap2, person", cap2, person);
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread ** WORKING
      const cap3 = { ...person, name: "Tom", age: 15, number: 20 };
      // console.log("cap3, person", cap3, person);
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const me = {
        name: "Me",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@sohamasmi",
          facebook: "na"
        }
      };
      console.clear();
      // console.log("me", me);

      const dev = Object.assign({}, me, { type: "dev" });
      dev.name = "greg";
      // console.log("dev, me", dev, me);
      // but this is only shallow:
      dev.social.twitter = "@whattt";
      // the change once gain affects both objects:
      // console.log("dev, me", dev, me);

      // another way
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(me));
      dev2.social.twitter = "@dopeman";
      // this acts like a deep clone:
      // console.log("dev2.social, me.social", dev2.social, me.social);
